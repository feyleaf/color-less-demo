====Color~Less Demo====
This is a tech demo from Feyleaf Game Studio's #gamedev Daily series on YouTube (days 176-180)
The goal is to move the butterfly between the yellow and green orbs without draining all of its color.
If you hover too closely to the black orbs, particles of the butterfly's color will be pulled out
of it, and the butterfly will fade.
Touching the YELLOW and GREEN orbs will instantly restore the color.

===
Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move
Windows Close [X] button: Exit the game
===

Thank you for trying this, please feel free to use this code and experiment.
